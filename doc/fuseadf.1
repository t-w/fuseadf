.SH NAME
fuseadf \- Mount an ADF image and read files with FUSE.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fuseadf
[\fBoptions\fR] <\fIimage_adf\fR> <\fImount point\fR>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfuseadf\fR is a simple libfuse-based filesystem allowing to mount
an ADF image of an Amiga floppy or hard disk and to read its contents
(volumes/partitions, directories and files).
.PP
Volumes/partitions can be chosen with -p option (not needed for images with
one volume only, ie. floppy disk images).
.PP
The filesystem is written for simplicity, not performance. It uses probably
minimal set of FUSE API functions that allows to create a working filesystem.
It is intended for simple accessing the contents of ADF images without copying
/ extracting all data from them.
