FUSEADF
-------

Fuseadf is a simple libfuse-based filesystem allowing to mount an ADF image of
an Amiga floppy or a hard disk and to read its contents (volumes / partitions,
directories and files).

Volumes / partitions can be chosen with -p option (not needed for images with
one volume only, ie. floppy disk images).

Usage:

fuseadf [options] <image_adf> <mount point>

where options can be:
       -p     Specify volume/partition (number) to mount (default: 0).
       -v     Show version.
       -h     Show usage info.


Building, testing and installation - see INSTALL.

Notes:
- It should be considered a prototype, so please beware of, for instance,
  security implications, especially if you get the disk images from uncertain
  sources.
- Writing on disk images is not supported, I may appear (or not...) in
  the future.
