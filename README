FUSEADF
-------

Fuseadf is a simple libfuse-based filesystem allowing to mount a volume of
an ADF image (of an Amiga floppy or a hard disk) and to browse/read/write
files and directories it contains.

Volumes / partitions can be chosen with -p option (not needed for images
with one volume only, ie. floppy disk images).

Usage:

fuseadf [options] <image_adf> <mount point>

where options can be:
    -p partition - partition/volume number (0-10), default: 0
    -l logfile   - enable logging and (optionally) specify logging file,
                   default log file: fuseadf.log
    -i           - ignore checksum errors (default: do not ignore!)
    -h           - show help info
    -V           - show version

Additionally, some FUSE options can be used (for details see FUSE documentation):
    -o mount_options -  list of mount options (ie. 'ro' for read-only mount)
                     -  (see: man fusermount)
    -f               -  run in foreground (do not daemonize)
    -d               -  run in foreground with more verbose (debug) info
    -s               -  single-threaded (enforced - no need to provide it)

(check -h for details).

Notes:

- It should be considered a (working) prototype, so please beware of,
  for instance, security implications, especially if you get the disk images
  from uncertain sources.

- It relies on the ADFlib (https://github.com/lclevy/ADFlib) for accessing
  ADF disk images.

- It should be used only in FUSE's single-threaded mode(!). Running in
  multithreaded mode, with multiple processes accessing the filesystem in
  parallel, may result in corrupted data, so beware (esp. when writing data).

  (Since 0.3, the FUSE's single-threaded mode is enforced, adding -s is no
  longer needed).
