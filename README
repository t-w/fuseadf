FUSEADF
-------

Fuseadf is a simple libfuse-based filesystem allowing to mount a volume of
an ADF image (of an Amiga floppy or a hard disk) and to browse/read/write
files and directories it contains.

Volumes / partitions can be chosen with -p option (not needed for images
with one volume only, ie. floppy disk images).

Usage:

fuseadf [options] <image_adf> <mount point>

where options can be:
       -p     Specify volume/partition (number) to mount (default: 0).
       -v     Show version.
       -h     Show usage info.

(plus FUSE options, check -h for details).

Notes:

- It should be considered a prototype, so please beware of, for instance,
  security implications, especially if you get the disk images from uncertain
  sources.

- It relies on the ADFlib (https://github.com/lclevy/ADFlib) for accessing
  ADF disk images.

- It should be used only in FUSE's single-thread mode(!). Running in
  multithreaded mode, with multiple processes accessing the filesystem in
  parallel, may result in corrupted data, so beware (esp. when writing data).

  (Single threaded mode may be enforced in the future - but it is not at
  the moment and the default for FUSE is multithreaded mode(!), so always
  use -s option).
