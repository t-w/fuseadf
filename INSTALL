General information
-------------------

fuseadf require ADFlib (link below) for building and operation (if shared
library is used).

Testing require also the Check testing framework for C (link below).

There are 2 buildsystems that can be used - CMake and autotools (links below).
Obviously, a requirement for building is installation of the chosen one.


Building with CMake
-------------------

There are helper scripts in the util/ directory, which should help in quick
builds, for instance, to build release version:
1. $ util/cmake_release_configure
2. $ util/cmake_release_build

Debug version (with gdb and address sanitizer) can be built in the same way,
just replace "release" with "debug" in the commands above.


Building with Autotools
-----------------------

Standard way:
1. $ ./autogen.sh
2. $ ./configure
3. $ make


Testing
-------

Some tests require presence of test images. They are not stored in
the repository and have to be downloaded using scripts in tests/testdata/.
The images are downloaded from:
- ADFlib's repository
- a collection of the Public Domain disks (one of the Fred Fish disks)


Testing with CMake
------------------

After successful building (see above), automatic tests can be started with:

  $ util/test_release   (for the release version)
  $ util/test_debug     (for the debug version)


Testing with Autotools
----------------------

After successful building (see above), automatic tests can be started with:

  $ make check


Installation with CMake
-----------------------

To default location:
 
 $ util/cmake_release_install

To a custom location:

  $ util/cmake_release_install [custom_prefix]


Installation with autotools
---------------------------

To configured location:

  $ make install

To change default location, do:

  $ ./configure --help

and look for prefix options)


Building a Debian package
-------------------------

To build a .deb package for Debian (or any derivative), use the helper script:

  $ util/build_deb.sh

In the parent directory of the project(!), it will create:
- source package (.tar.gz)
- binary packages (.deb)
