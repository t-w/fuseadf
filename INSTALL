General information
--------------------

fuseadf require ADFlib (link below) for building and operation (if shared
library is used).

Testing require also the Check testing framework for C (link below).

There are 2 buildsystems that can be used - CMake and autotools (links below).
Obviously, a requirement for building is installation of the chosen one.


Building with CMake
--------------------

There are helper scripts in the util/ directory, which should help doing quick
builds. For instance, to build the release version:
1. $ util/cmake_release_configure
2. $ util/cmake_release_build

Debug version (with gdb and address sanitizer) can be built in the same way,
just replace "release" with "debug" in the commands above.

To (eventually) remove the build subdirectory use:
   $ util/cmake_clean

(all have to be configured again for building).


Building with Autotools
------------------------

Standard way:
1. $ ./autogen.sh
2. $ ./configure
3. $ make


Testing
--------

Some tests require presence of test images. They are not stored in
the repository and have to be downloaded using scripts in tests/testdata/.
The images are downloaded from:
- ADFlib's repository
- a collection of the Public Domain disks (one of the Fred Fish disks)


Testing with CMake
-------------------

After successful building (see above), automatic tests can be started with:

  $ util/test_release   (for the release version)
  $ util/test_debug     (for the debug version)


Testing with Autotools
-----------------------

After successful building (see above), automatic tests can be started with:

  $ make check


Installation with CMake
------------------------

To default location:
 
 $ util/cmake_release_install

To a custom location:

  $ util/cmake_release_install [custom_prefix]


Installation with autotools
----------------------------

To a configured location:

  $ make install

To change default location, do:

  $ ./configure --help

and look for prefix options.


Building Debian packages
-------------------------

To build a .deb package for Debian (or any derivative), use the helper script:

  $ util/deb_build.sh

In the parent(!) directory of the project, it will create:
- a source package (.tar.gz)
- binary packages (.deb)

The source package alone can be created with:

  $ util/deb_create_quilt3_archive.sh
